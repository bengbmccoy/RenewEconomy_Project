***README***

***Welcome to Ben McCoy's online Guthub RenewEconomy Scrape repo!***

In this repo is my project involving scraping and storing RenewEconomy articles
as HTML files along with some metadata such as author and date scraped. These
articles will be used as data for future analysis. The idea will be to perform
some kind of statistical analysis on the articles but exactly how this is works
is to be decided.

Currently there are 5 items within this online repo:
- readme.md - This file
- .gitignore - ignores all .html files
- url_database.csv - Stores urls (and meta data) that has been saved
- pages_
- renewecon_scrape.py - script that accesses new articles and saves them as
html files in the pages_ directory

I hope yo enjoy your time in the repo.

Regards,

Ben
